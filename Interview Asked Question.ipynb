    "Stationarity:-  A time series is said to be stationary if its statistical properties, such as mean, variance, and autocorrelation, do not change over time. Stationarity is a crucial assumption for many time series models because it simplifies the modeling process. Non-stationary time series may exhibit trends or seasonality, making it challenging to make accurate predictions.\n",
